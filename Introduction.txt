1. what is cloud computing?
ans : "The cloud"  is refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. 
       Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have 
        to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

2. Deployement model in cloud?
ans : the four deployement model in cloud.
       1. private cloud : A private cloud is a server, data center, or distributed network wholly dedicated to one organization. 
              Resources are used exclusively by a single organization. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. 
              They offer greater control and customization but may require more management.
       2. public cloud : A public cloud is a service run by an external vendor that may include servers in one or multiple data centers. 
              Unlike a private cloud, public clouds are shared by multiple organizations. 
              Services are offered over the internet to anyone who wants to use them. 
              Public cloud resources are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
              Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
       3. hybrid cloud : Combines both public and private cloud resources, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Hybrid cloud enables greater flexibility 
          and optimization of existing infrastructure.
       4. comunnating cloud : it will use that private and public cloud. 

3. service model in cloud?
ans :   1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. 
       Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

       2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform that includes development tools, databases, and application hosting environments. 
       PaaS enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Examples include Google App Engine and Heroku.

       3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 
       Users can access these applications through web browsers without needing to install or maintain software locally. 
       Examples include Gmail, Microsoft 365, and Salesforce.

4. what is service? and what are resources?
ans : The resource is the “thing” the service is “what it does”. In AWS, a resource is an entity that you can work with. 
      AWS is a platform that offers both core cloud capabilities and the services that enable them to evolve as they move along their cloud journey. 
       AWS provides building blocks that you can assemble quickly to support virtually any workload.
