EC2 Notes
ELastic compute cloud :  amazone ec2 provider scalability compability capacity in the aws cloud 
how to limit the ec2 instance each region limit the create the instance is 20.(importan is interview question)

type of ec2 instance total is 7
 general purposes : balanced the momory and cpu
compute optimize : more cpu than RAM
memory optimized : more RAM
accelerated computing and gpu : graphics optimization
storage optimization : low latancy 
high memory optimizated : high RAM NITRO SYSTEM

GENERAL OPTIMIZATION : General purpose instance provide a balance of computer memory and networking resources and can be used for variety of work load.
3 server of general purpose series A (A1) SERVER (IT WILL PROVIDE THE MEDIUM AND LARGE), T (T2) SERVER(AVALABLE SERVER NANO MICRO MEDIUM LARGE) AND M (M4, M5,)SERVER(AVALABLE LARGE SERVER)
